\Large {\bf Foreword} \normalsize

The purpose of this handbook is to give new Observatory PhD
students information to facilitate their settling in at the
Observatory and to provide all postgraduate students with a
student orientated digest of the plethora of information that 
they will be bombarded withthroughout the course of their PhD studies.


This handbook is aimed very much at the postgraduate students in
the Institute (IfA) and so is informal in tone and content. On arrival you may find life somewhat confusing while you find your feet and this guide is aimed
at minimising that confusion.


The most important thing to take away from this entire document is; 
`don't be afraid to ask questions of anyone' --
it will speed your settling in at the Observatory as well as make you more
productive. Remember that everyone working here has been in your shoes before
and that most people are flattered if you ask questions of them and
will be eager to respond.
